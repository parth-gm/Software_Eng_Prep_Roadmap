You may do this for reasons

1. Security Resons
2. Object is intensive to create
3. To Access from remote location (Based on what fields are available for
   outside access)


Example of ATMProxy over ATMClass 
Which provide limited access of data or methods to manager

Only above 2 methods are part of proxy class. Manager should not able to view or write
confidential data members or methods.
