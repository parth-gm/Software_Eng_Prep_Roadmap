Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that two can vary
independently.

Say you have a geometric Shape class with a pair of subclasses: Circle and Square. You want to extend this class hierarchy to incorporate colors, 
so you plan to create Red and Blue shape subclasses. However, since you already have 
two subclasses, you’ll need to create four class combinations such as BlueCircle and 
RedSquare.

Adding new shape types and colors to the hierarchy will grow it exponentially. 
For example, to add a triangle shape you’d need to introduce two subclasses, 
one for each color. And after that, adding a new color would require creating 
three subclasses, one for each shape type. The further we go, the worse it becomes.

The Bridge pattern attempts to solve this problem by switching 
from inheritance to the object composition
